# PredictingBostonHousePrices
# Linear Regression Project

This project utilizes the `statsmodels` library in Python to perform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression for predicting a target variable based on a set of independent features. The primary focus is on understanding and analyzing linear relationships between variables.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Install required libraries using:

 Run the regression analysis script:

3. Explore the results and further analyze the regression model.

## Project Structure

- `regression_analysis.py`: Python script containing the linear regression analysis using `statsmodels`.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample data for training the model.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your improvements or suggestions.


## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the `statsmodels` library for providing robust tools for statistical modeling in Python.
